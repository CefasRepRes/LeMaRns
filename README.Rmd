# LeMaRns

Set up, run and explore the outputs of the Length-based Multi-species model LeMans, focused on the marine environment.

## Installation

You can install the released version of LeMaRns from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("LeMaRns")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how to set up, run and plot the resulting Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB):

```{r example}
library(LeMaRns)
NS_params <- LeMansParam(NS_par, tau=NS_tau, eta=eta, L50=L50, other=1e12)
effort <- matrix(0.25, 50, dim(NS_params @Qs)[3])
model_run <- run_LeMans(NS_params, years=50, effort=effort)
plot_SSB(NS_params, model_run)
```
